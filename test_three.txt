Whispers of the Night

In the quiet of the night, When stars ignite their cosmic dance, The moon, a silver lantern, Guides lost souls with gentle glance.

The wind weaves secrets through the trees, And shadows stretch like ink on parchment. Dreams unfurl, delicate and free, As nightfall wraps the world in hushed enchantment.
